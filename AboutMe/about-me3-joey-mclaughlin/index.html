                    <h2>Vacations!</h2>

                    <p>
                        The first trip I took over my summer vacation was to San Diego, California. In San Diego I went to the beach and had lots of fun swimming and making sand castles. My hotel was on the beach so I could walk to the beach whenever I wanted to. After I left the beach I got ice cream with my family and walked on the boardwalk.

                        The next trip I took was to Alpine, Arizona. In Alpine I fished, hiked in the rain, ate pizza, watched movies, and played board games. My favorite was when I went hiking with my family. Hiking with my family was my favorite because we saw a lot of wildlife. We saw three owls and some elk. When we went fishing we didn't catch anything so it wasn't very fun.

                            <h2>Boost</h2>

                            <p>
                                Another activity I did over the summer was Boost. Boost was fun and like school. It was like school because we got homework and had to study even though it wasn't school. I wish that boost didn't have homework and didn't have tests. But I did like the party at the end because we got pizza, chips, and soda. But even though Boost had homework I still liked it.

                        <h2>Sleeping</h2>

                        <p>
                            Over the summer I slept on average about twelve hours a day. Sleeping is very good for your body and when you don't sleep your body can't recharge to get you ready for the next day. So as you can tell sleeping is very important. Over the summer I finally caught up on sleep, but then school started...
